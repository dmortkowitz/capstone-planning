# Working title: Bookshelf App
_By David Mortkowitz_

## Project Summary

> Organize reading libraries, and help plot out reading schedules, for independent reading or book club purposes. Useful for digital or print collections.

## Project MVP: 
* Accept and store book submissions (title, author, number of pages, summary, completion goal date) 
User account/authentication.
* Simple User Interface for adding, updating, and deleting books
* Updating reading progress


## Tools and Frameworks used: 

* React
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS/possibly Bootstrap
* jQuery
* Firebase, for early/small-scale user authentication 


## Expected Future Updates: 

* Updating reading progress
* Multiple Bookshelves that can be sorted and divided by theme or genre
* Add Reading Goal due dates (or possible count down to target) on bookshelf
* Books organized by Currently Reading, To Be Read, and Have Completed
* Able to pull book information (ex. cover image, page count, summary) via API from an open database, such as Google Books or Amazon. 
* A more developed GUI, simulating further interactivity
* Sorting book shelves by title, author, and by progress
* Community message boards
* Community chat rooms
* Eventually, users will be able to connect to each other based on reading preferences, to form digital book clubs. This would allow them to connect by books currently read, and schedule a reading plan together so they can have periodic discussions. 
* Users will be able to set libraries and progress to public or private. 

## Additional resources expected to be used for future updates: 

* A database
* An API
* SQL
* Possibly, yet to be determined Frameworks or additional languages with (if necessary) bridge languages included. 

## Final notes

> This project is really flexible, and the MVP is significantly smaller than the planned, eventual fully-developed app. I donâ€™t expect to have an elaborate GUI for the MVP spec, but I do plan on continuing to work and develop this project into the future until it meets my personal end-goals.
